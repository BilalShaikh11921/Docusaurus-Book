# Foundations of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems

Welcome to the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) module, where you'll explore the revolutionary approach to robotics that combines perception, language understanding, and action execution in a unified system.

## Module Overview

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems represent a paradigm shift in robotics, where robots can understand and execute natural language commands through integrated perception and action capabilities. This module covers the fundamental concepts that enable robots to interact naturally with humans and their environment.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. **Understand VLA Systems**: Explain what Vision-Language-Action systems are and their three core components (vision, language, action)
2. **Process Natural Language Commands**: Describe how language commands are processed and mapped to robotic goals
3. **Distinguish Planning from Control**: Understand the difference between high-level planning and low-level control in action pipelines
4. **Integrate with ROS 2**: Explain how VLA systems fit into existing robotic architectures like ROS 2
5. **Apply Perception Grounding**: Understand the role of perception in grounding actions and providing context

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three comprehensive chapters:

- **Chapter 1: Introduction to Vision-Language-Action** - Foundational concepts of VLA systems
- **Chapter 2: Language to Intent** - Processing natural language commands and mapping them to goals
- **Chapter 3: From Intent to Action Pipelines** - Execution architecture and ROS 2 integration

## Prerequisites

This module assumes basic knowledge of:
- Robotics fundamentals
- Artificial Intelligence concepts
