# Stability-Aware Path Planning Exercise

## Objective
Implement and test stability-aware path planning for humanoid robot navigation.

## Prerequisites
- Humanoid Nav2 configuration with constraints
- Understanding of stability concepts in humanoid robotics
- Isaac ROS perception and navigation integration

## Exercise Steps

### Step 1: Configure Stability-Aware Planning
1. Set up stability-aware path planning algorithms
2. Configure stability metrics and thresholds
3. Integrate with existing navigation stack

### Step 2: Implement Stability Monitoring
1. Add stability assessment during path planning
2. Configure real-time stability monitoring
3. Set up stability recovery behaviors

### Step 3: Test Stability-Aware Navigation
1. Execute navigation tasks with stability planning
2. Monitor stability metrics during navigation
3. Verify safe navigation behavior

### Step 4: Validate Stability Performance
1. Test navigation in stability-challenging scenarios
2. Verify stability maintenance during navigation
3. Assess impact on navigation efficiency

### Step 5: Optimize Stability Parameters
1. Fine-tune stability planning parameters
2. Balance safety and navigation performance
3. Validate optimized configuration

## Expected Results
- Stability-aware path planning operational
- Navigation maintains stability throughout
- Safe navigation demonstrated in challenging scenarios

## Troubleshooting
- If stability is compromised, strengthen stability constraints
- If navigation is too conservative, adjust safety margins
- If performance degrades, optimize stability calculations

## Next Steps
Complete the module by reviewing all concepts and applying them to your humanoid robot projects.
