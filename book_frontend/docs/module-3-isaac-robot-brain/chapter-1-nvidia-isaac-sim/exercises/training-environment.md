# Training Environment Setup Exercise

## Objective
Set up a comprehensive training environment in Isaac Sim for humanoid robot applications.

## Prerequisites
- Isaac Sim environment with humanoid robot
- Understanding of environment design principles

## Exercise Steps

### Step 1: Design Environment Layout
1. Plan the layout of the training environment
2. Consider different scenarios for humanoid training
3. Design pathways and navigation areas

### Step 2: Implement Environment Elements
1. Add walls, obstacles, and navigation elements
2. Configure physics properties for all objects
3. Set up lighting and visual properties

### Step 3: Configure Training Scenarios
1. Set up different training scenarios
2. Configure randomization parameters
3. Plan data collection strategies

### Step 4: Test Environment Functionality
1. Test robot navigation through the environment
2. Verify all sensors function correctly
3. Check that physics simulation behaves as expected

### Step 5: Optimize Performance
1. Optimize environment for simulation performance
2. Adjust complexity for efficient training
3. Validate environment stability

## Expected Results
- Training environment set up and functional
- Robot can navigate through the environment
- Environment optimized for efficient training

## Troubleshooting
- If simulation is slow, reduce environment complexity
- If physics is unstable, adjust parameters
- If sensors fail, verify configurations
