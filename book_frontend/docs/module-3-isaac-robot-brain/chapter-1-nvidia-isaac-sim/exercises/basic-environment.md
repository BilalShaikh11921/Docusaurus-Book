# Basic Isaac Sim Environment Exercise

## Objective
Learn to set up a basic Isaac Sim environment for humanoid robot simulation.

## Prerequisites
- Isaac Sim installed and configured
- Basic understanding of USD and Omniverse concepts

## Exercise Steps

### Step 1: Launch Isaac Sim
1. Start Isaac Sim application
2. Verify that the application launches without errors
3. Familiarize yourself with the interface

### Step 2: Create a New Stage
1. Create a new USD stage
2. Set up basic physics properties
3. Configure gravity and other physical parameters

### Step 3: Add a Humanoid Robot
1. Import a basic humanoid robot model
2. Verify that the robot model loads correctly
3. Check that all joints and actuators are properly configured

### Step 4: Set Up Basic Environment
1. Add a ground plane for the robot to stand on
2. Configure basic lighting for the scene
3. Add simple obstacles for navigation

### Step 5: Test Simulation
1. Run the simulation to verify robot stability
2. Test basic robot movements
3. Verify that physics simulation works correctly

## Expected Results
- Isaac Sim environment running successfully
- Humanoid robot stable in the environment
- Basic physics simulation working correctly

## Troubleshooting
- If the robot falls through the ground, check collision properties
- If joints are not moving, verify actuator configuration
- If simulation is unstable, adjust physics parameters

## Next Steps
Continue to the next exercise to learn about synthetic data generation.
