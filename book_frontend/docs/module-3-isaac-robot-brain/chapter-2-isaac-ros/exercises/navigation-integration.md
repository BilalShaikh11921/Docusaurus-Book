# Navigation Integration Exercise

## Objective
Integrate Isaac ROS perception with navigation systems for humanoid robot navigation.

## Prerequisites
- Isaac ROS VSLAM operational
- Isaac Sim environment with humanoid robot
- Understanding of navigation concepts

## Exercise Steps

### Step 1: Set Up Navigation Stack
1. Install and configure Nav2 for humanoid navigation
2. Configure costmap parameters for humanoid constraints
3. Set up localization system using VSLAM

### Step 2: Integrate Perception Data
1. Connect Isaac ROS perception to navigation costmaps
2. Configure sensor data fusion
3. Verify data flow between systems

### Step 3: Test Navigation Performance
1. Plan and execute navigation tasks
2. Monitor navigation performance and safety
3. Measure success rates and efficiency

### Step 4: Validate Integration
1. Test navigation with perception data
2. Compare performance with and without Isaac ROS
3. Assess computational requirements

### Step 5: Optimize Integration
1. Fine-tune integration parameters
2. Optimize computational performance
3. Validate safety and reliability

## Expected Results
- Isaac ROS perception integrated with navigation
- Successful navigation tasks completed
- Performance improvements demonstrated

## Troubleshooting
- If navigation fails, check perception data quality
- If integration fails, verify data formats and timing
- If performance is poor, optimize system configuration
