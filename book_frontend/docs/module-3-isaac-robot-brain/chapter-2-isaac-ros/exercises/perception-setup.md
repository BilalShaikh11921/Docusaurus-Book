# Isaac ROS Perception Setup Exercise

## Objective
Set up Isaac ROS perception packages and integrate them with a humanoid robot system.

## Prerequisites
- Isaac Sim environment with humanoid robot
- Isaac ROS packages installed
- Basic ROS/ROS2 knowledge

## Exercise Steps

### Step 1: Install Isaac ROS Packages
1. Verify Isaac ROS packages are installed
2. Check package dependencies
3. Ensure GPU acceleration is available

### Step 2: Configure Perception Pipeline
1. Set up Isaac ROS Image Pipeline
2. Configure camera calibration parameters
3. Verify sensor data flow

### Step 3: Integrate with Isaac Sim
1. Connect Isaac Sim sensors to Isaac ROS
2. Verify data transmission between systems
3. Test perception pipeline with simulated data

### Step 4: Test Perception Performance
1. Run perception algorithms on simulated data
2. Measure performance improvements
3. Compare with CPU-based approaches

### Step 5: Validate Results
1. Check perception accuracy
2. Verify real-time performance
3. Assess computational efficiency

## Expected Results
- Isaac ROS perception pipeline operational
- Performance improvements demonstrated
- Integration with Isaac Sim verified

## Troubleshooting
- If GPU acceleration fails, check CUDA installation
- If sensor data doesn't flow, verify connections
- If performance is poor, check system configuration

## Next Steps
Continue to VSLAM implementation exercise.
