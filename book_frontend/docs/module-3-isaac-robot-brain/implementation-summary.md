## Key Features Implemented

1. **Isaac Sim Integration**: Comprehensive content on setting up simulation environments and generating synthetic data
2. **Isaac ROS Integration**: Detailed lessons on accelerated perception, VSLAM, and navigation
3. **Nav2 for Humanoid Robots**: Specialized content on path planning with humanoid-specific constraints
4. **Practical Exercises**: Hands-on exercises for each major concept
5. **Docusaurus Integration**: Fully integrated into the documentation site with proper navigation

## Technical Architecture

The module leverages the Isaac Sim + Isaac ROS + Nav2 integration for optimal sim-to-real transfer capabilities, GPU-accelerated processing, and comprehensive toolset for humanoid robotics development. The content covers all three key areas: simulation, perception, and navigation specifically adapted for humanoid robots.
