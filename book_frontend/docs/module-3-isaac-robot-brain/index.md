# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

## Overview

This module provides comprehensive educational content for AI engineers, robotics developers, and advanced students working on humanoid robotics using the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem. The implementation covers three key areas: (1) NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation, (2) Isaac ROS for accelerated perception, VSLAM, and navigation, and (3) Nav2 path planning specifically adapted for humanoid robot movement.

## Target Audience

- AI engineers working with humanoid robotics
- Robotics developers implementing perception and navigation systems
- Advanced students studying robotics simulation and control

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, you will be able to:

1. Set up and configure NVIDIA Isaac Sim environments for humanoid robot training
2. Integrate Isaac ROS packages for accelerated perception and navigation
3. Implement Nav2-based path planning adapted for humanoid-specific constraints
4. Generate synthetic datasets using Isaac Sim for training perception models
5. Achieve effective sim-to-real transfer for humanoid robotics applications

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three chapters:

1. **Chapter 1: NVIDIA Isaac Sim Training Environment** - Learn to set up simulation environments and generate synthetic data
2. **Chapter 2: Isaac ROS Integration for Perception** - Integrate GPU-accelerated perception packages
3. **Chapter 3: Nav2 Path Planning for Humanoid Movement** - Implement navigation with humanoid-specific constraints

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Basic understanding of robotics concepts and ROS/ROS2
- Access to NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS environment
- Familiarity with Python and C++ programming

## Getting Started

Begin with Chapter 1 to learn about setting up Isaac Sim environments for humanoid robot simulation and training.
