# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the AI/Spec-Driven Technical Book. This module focuses on creating high-fidelity digital twins of humanoid robots using Gazebo for physics simulation and Unity for visualization. Digital twins allow you to safely train, test, and validate physical AI systems before real-world deployment.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Explain the role of digital twins in humanoid robotics
- Simulate physics, gravity, and collisions using Gazebo
- Build interactive, human-scale environments in Unity
- Model and reason about virtual sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs)

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Completed Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts
- Knowledge of URDF robot modeling
- A development environment with ROS 2 (Humble Hawksbill) installed

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three chapters:

### Chapter 1: Physics & Reality in Gazebo
- World building, gravity, collisions, and dynamics
- Integrating URDF humanoids into simulation
- Understanding how physics constraints affect robot behavior

### Chapter 2: High-Fidelity Interaction with Unity
- Visual realism and human-robot interaction
- Synchronizing robot state between ROS 2 and Unity
- Creating interactive simulation environments

### Chapter 3: Virtual Sensor Simulation
- Simulating LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs
- Understanding sensor data generation
- Reasoning about virtual sensor outputs

## Getting Started

Begin with Chapter 1 to understand the fundamentals of physics simulation in Gazebo. Each chapter builds upon the previous one, so we recommend following the sequence for optimal learning.
