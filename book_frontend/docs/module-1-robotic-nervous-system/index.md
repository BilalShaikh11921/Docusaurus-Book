# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to the first module of our robotics course! In this module, you'll learn how ROS 2 serves as the "nervous system" of humanoid robots, connecting software intelligence with physical actuators.

## What You'll Learn

- The fundamentals of ROS 2 architecture
- How to build and connect ROS 2 nodes using Python
- Creating URDF models for humanoid robots
- Bridging AI agents to robot controllers

## Chapters

1. [Chapter 1: ROS 2 as a Robotic Nervous System](./ros2-overview) - Learn about ROS 2 architecture and its role in humanoid robotics
2. [Chapter 2: Building ROS 2 Nodes with Python](./rclpy-agents) - Build and connect ROS 2 nodes using Python (rclpy)
3. [Chapter 3: Creating URDF Models for Humanoid Robots](./urdf-humanoids) - Describe and author URDF models for humanoid robots
4. [Chapter 4: Bridging AI Agents to Robot Controllers](./ai-robot-bridge) - Connect AI agents to robot controllers via ROS middleware

Let's get started!
