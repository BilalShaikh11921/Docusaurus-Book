# Digital Twin Simulation Module Planning

## Prompt Text

- set up Module-2 in Docusaurus with structured chapters for Gazebo & Unity simulations (physics, environments, sensors). - All content written as .md files, organized per chapter for easy navigation.

## Response Text

Completed comprehensive implementation planning for the Digital Twin Simulation module including:

- Updated implementation plan with technical context, constitution check, and project structure
- Created research.md with technical research, decisions, and best practices
- Created data-model.md defining the educational content structure
- Created quickstart.md with setup instructions and module overview
- Created contracts/education-api.yaml defining API for educational content access
- All artifacts organized in the specs/002-digital-twin-sim directory
- Plan aligned with project constitution and technical requirements
