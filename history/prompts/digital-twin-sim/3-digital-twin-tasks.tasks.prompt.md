# Digital Twin Simulation Module Tasks

## Prompt Text

$ARGUMENTS

## Response Text

Generated comprehensive implementation tasks for the Digital Twin Simulation module with 7 phases:

- Phase 1: Setup tasks (T001-T005) - Project structure preparation
- Phase 2: Foundational tasks (T010-T013) - Module foundation
- Phase 3: [US1] Basic Gazebo Simulation (T020-T029) - Priority 1 user story
- Phase 4: [US2] URDF Integration (T040-T047) - Priority 2 user story
- Phase 5: [US3] Unity Visualization (T060-T067) - Priority 3 user story
- Phase 6: [US4] Sensor Simulation (T080-T087) - Priority 2 user story
- Phase 7: Polish & Cross-cutting (T100-T111) - Quality and completion

All tasks follow the checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths. The implementation strategy focuses on MVP with User Story 1 as the core deliverable.
