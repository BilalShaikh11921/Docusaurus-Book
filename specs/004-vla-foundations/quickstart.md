# Quickstart: VLA Foundations Module

## Overview
This guide helps you understand and implement the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) educational module for the technical book.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of robotics and AI concepts
- Understanding of Docusaurus documentation framework
- Familiarity with Markdown syntax

## Getting Started

### 1. Understanding VLA Systems
- Learn about the three core components: Vision, Language, Action
- Explore how these components work together in robotic systems
- Review real-world examples of VLA applications

### 2. Language-to-Intent Pipeline
- Study how natural language commands are processed
- Understand the mapping from commands like "Clean the room" to robotic goals
- Learn about voice-to-text processing concepts

### 3. Action Pipeline Architecture
- Distinguish between high-level planning and low-level control
- Understand the role of perception in action grounding
- Learn how VLA systems integrate with ROS 2 architectures

## Implementation Steps

1. Create the three Docusaurus chapters in the `docs/module-4-vla-foundations/` directory
2. Write comprehensive content for each chapter covering the specified topics
3. Include relevant diagrams and examples to illustrate concepts
4. Ensure content aligns with the success criteria from the specification
5. Test the documentation by verifying it builds correctly in Docusaurus

## Key Resources
- VLA research papers and documentation
- ROS 2 documentation for integration patterns
- Docusaurus documentation for content formatting
